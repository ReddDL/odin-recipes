    <p>Pork Nilaga is a type of Filipino pork soup in clear broth. I used pork belly in this version along with other ingredients such as potato, saba banana, and pechay (or baby bok choy). It is a perfect dish that you can enjoy during cold and rainy weather. In this nilaga version, I added Knorr Pork Cube to provide more flavor to the dish.  I suggest that you serve this hot with a small bowl or saucer of fish sauce (with chili pepper if you prefer it  a bit spicy) on the side.</p>
